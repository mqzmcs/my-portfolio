2024 MAR <br /><blockquote>I built this portfolio using React for a dynamic front end. It is paired to a RESTful API on a JSON Server configured with Node.js. I chose this option for lightweight data persistence. I intentionally utilize vanilla CSS here to further my understanding of fundamental elements and how they come together. This project is constantly evolving, with possible features like a MongoDB server and user authentication for admin CRUD operations and enhanced backend functionality. -- Alfonso</blockquote>
